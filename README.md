# Rise of Diabetes in the US

In the recent years, the United States has seen a transformative shift in tackling healthcare issues. One issue is the rise of diabetes and the challenges that comes with living with a life changing problem. Amidst rising prevalence rates, there has emerged a resolute determination among communities in healthcare and policymakers to confront this issue with optimism and innovation. With optimism, education and innovation the United States Healthcare System has become proactive in preventing diabetes to continue to rise. In this study you will see that we decided to see why the rise of diabetes is still an ongoing issue even with the populous being more informed about diabetes.  

After much thought, our group decided to look at the variables and determined that high cholesterol, diet, physical activity, and high blood pressure will be the most prevelent variables to focus on when building our model. Our data was used from Kaggle.com. Kaggle has data from over 250k individuels with and without diabetes.

# Overview
With the populous being more informed about diabetes and yet there is still a rise in diebetics, why is this problem still happening? With the population consuming carbonated drinks and food that is high in sugar like baked products made with ingredients that are causing chronic inflammation and packed ready to eat meals along with fried foods being the norm in the US for most people there is a common underline on why diebetes is still rising. Even though the United States population is more informed about the issues most of the people still see fast food, sit in diners, meals that can be consumed fast as the life style that is best suited for them. The life style that most people live is fast paced and the majority feels as if they need everything at that moment and don't want to take the time or spend the extra money to shop for healthier alternative ingrediants or cook for themselves.
