# Using Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Models for Diabetes Prediction using limited features.

Our decision tree model was used to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. The dataset was preprocessed and the decision tree classifier was trained and evaluated. We visualized the model's performance using matplotlib.
Our logistic regression model was used to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators.

## Project Overview

The goal our project was to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on high blood pressure, general health, education, and income.
The project uses a decision tree classifier to make predictions and evaluates its performance using various metrics.
We used the decision tree to visualize and understand the decision-making process.
We also built a logistic regression model to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals based on High Blood Pressure, General Health, Education, and Income using a data set comprised of CDC data.

## Dataset

"The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Every year the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services.
It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project a CSV of the dataset was available on Kaggle for the year 2015 to be used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These questions directly ask of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses."

Our process that we took to clean up the data:
